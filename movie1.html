            <li>A guy named Sauron makes a ring and wants to take over the planet because of course he does, but he's defeated</li>
            <li>Hobbit Bilbo Baggins finds the ring and holds on to it, eventually giving it to his nephew Frodo</li>
            <li>The wizard Gandalf sends Frodo on a quest to destroy the ring and sends him off with some friends</li>
            <li>The hobbits meet some cool folks like Aragorn and Arwen who save the hobbits from Sauron's minions</li>
            <li>The hobbits make the Fellowship of the Ring (hey, title drop!) to destroy the ring</li>
            <li>They are joined by Gandalf, Aragorn, Boromir, Gimli the dwarf and Legolas the elf</li>
            <li>500 hours of walking scenes commence, but the landscapes are gorgeous and the soundtrack is amazing so you don't care</li>
            <li>Now they have to go through a cave and Gandalf has to sacrifice himself to stop a fire demon, many tears are shed</li>
            <li>Afterwards Boromir gets corrupted by the ring, but he redeems himself and also sacrifices himself to save Frodo</li>
            <li>But now Frodo and Sam are on their own, and the two other hobbits Merry and Pippin are captured!</li>
            <li>So Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli decide to go save them and we end on a cliffhanger!!!</li>
            <li>Great start to the trilogy, we meet a fantastic cast of characters and we get our heartstrings pulled</li>
