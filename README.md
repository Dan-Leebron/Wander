# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Wander

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website (with potential for an app) which is essentially a Tinder-style matching system for
people who want to travel (not a dating site). You would match based on the location(s) you wish
to travel to as well as what you would want to do whilst there (e.g. partying, sight-seeing, relaxing, hiking etc.)

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our software is meant to connect travelers based on each user’s destination and preferences for a travel-buddy.
In terms of the kind of match the user is seeking, the user has two options. They can either a) select that they want to match
with anyone who is going to their desired location, regardless of either user’s current location, or b) select an unknown desired
location and match with people near current location that they want to travel to the destination with. Preferences for a travel-buddy
include group size, gender, interests, and age.

The match would be rated on how many of the selected interests overlap, and the user can filter who they come across in the app by things
like desired age/gender of travel partner, too. In an ideal world, we would love to have a safety/authentication feature (similar to Tinder’s
Facebook linking requirement), although this may not be achievable within the timeline of this semester.

We hope to build a website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, linked to SQL databases. The SQL database will contain a database of the people
using the site, filled out with a unique id per person, features about them such as their age and their locations/activities of interest,
which can be updated by the user. We will import an API that allows us to use the coordinates of cities/landmarks and we will make the matches
based off of proximity to the same coordinates.

## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The good outcome is a website that people can use to match with others based on a desired location.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The website allows users to screen their matches based on a variety of features, providing potential matches with an overall ‘compatibility’ rating.
If they choose, users will also be able to match based on current location for people to travel with.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome will include all the features in the good and better outcomes, along with the Facebook (or other) authentication feature.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We do not anticipate needing to learn new skills, but we hope to get more familiar with APIs.

Roles (Subject to change):

Connor: Website building

Daniel: Location matching system and ratings (new skills) & research Tinder and other matching algorithms

Jad: SQL storage/building database(s)

All group members will research what travellers would want from something like this.
