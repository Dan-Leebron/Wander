In order to run this website, all the user needs to do is enter “flask run” in the terminal of the
specified folder. Opening the link redirects you to the login page. If you’re a new user, you can
register for a new account by clicking on the link in the top right of the screen. This page asks
for name, email, gender, home country, destination, and bio. What this is essentially doing is
storing the new user’s information into a table in our database, called accounts. Once you register,
you are redirected to a page where you can upload an image to be inserted into your profile.
Clicking “Upload” redirects you the profile page the website has generated for you, which includes
the information input from the register page as well as the profile image.

Now that the profile is created, you may click “Matches” on the top right of the screen. This will
be an empty table as the you have probably not gotten the chance to match with other users yet. To
fill this table, the user can start selecting users to travel with by clicking “Find a Travel Friend”
on the top right of the screen. This page randomly selects users who have entered a destination
similar to yours. For example, if you entered “Aruba” as your desired location in the register page,
the matching page will show you all the users that have also entered Aruba as their desired location.
You can “Match,” i.e. indicate an interest in the specified user, or “Keep Wandering,” i.e. find
other users to possibly indicate an interest in travelling with. These are equivalent to swiping right
and swiping left, respectively, on Tinder. Once you have gone through all of your potential matches,
you will receive an apology message indicating you have run out of users. To see the other users again,
you can log out and back in again, as the apology message suggests.

If you click “Match” on a user, you are not necessarily going to see them in the “Matches” page. In
order to see someone in your matches, they would need to have clicked “Match” on your profile as well.
In a scenario where you click “Match” on someone that has already indicated the would like to match with
you too, then you can find them in the Matches table. The matches table shows the user and their email
address as a form of contact. The user can log out by clicking “Log out.” To test our project, we
recommend you create an account with the desired location of Italy. For these countries, we
have created other profiles which will appear to be matched with.
